# TicketHub Sample App

The TicketHub sample application for Styra Run.

TicketHub contains two components: a [back-end](backend/README.md), the server component hosting the API endpoints and business logic of the application; and a [front-end](frontend/README.md), another server component hosting the static resources of the web application. The front-end also proxies requests to the back-end.

## How to run

### Back-end

In this directory:

```sh
make run-backend
```

### Front-end

In this directory:

```sh
make run-frontend
```
